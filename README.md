# Assignment-1
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for the code to visualise the datasets.
The datasets are found in the Datasets folder. Ensure that they are stored in the same directory of the Jupyter Notebook if run locally.

We visualise NEET data as well as mental health age group statistics. Note that some datasets are manually created as there is no export of the datasets from the online sources.
